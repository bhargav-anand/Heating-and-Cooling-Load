# Heating-and-Cooling-Load
Predicting the heating and cooling load of the building using Neural Networks
For this project some base Regression models and ensemble are used and compared r2_score. 
Adding cooling load and heating load can define the overall load of the apartment. 
Study the trend of overall load and divide it into three classes, low efficient, high efficient and average efficient. 
Then train a deep learning model to predict the label. 

The dataset contains eight attributes (or features, denoted by X1...X8) and two responses (or outcomes, denoted by y1 and y2). 
The aim is to use the eight features to predict each of the two responses. 

X1	Relative Compactness 
X2	Surface Area 
X3	Wall Area 
X4	Roof Area 
X5	Overall Height 
X6	Orientation 
X7	Glazing Area 
X8	Glazing Area Distribution 
y1	Heating Load 
y2	Cooling Load
